# Voice-to-text-convertor
A voice-to-text converter, also known as a speech-to-text converter, It is a tool that automatically converts spoken words or audio into written text. This technology uses speech recognition algorithms to analyze audio signals and translate them into digital characters. It's often used to create transcripts of audio recordings for various purposes, such as note-taking, research, or accessibility. 
How it works:
Speech-to-text technology utilizes algorithms to analyze the sound waves from audio and identify the spoken words. This process involves: 
Input: The converter receives audio input, either from a microphone or a recorded audio file. 
Signal processing: The audio signal is analyzed to extract features like pitch, amplitude, and frequency. 
Speech recognition: Machine learning models, including large language models (LLMs), are used to map the audio features to corresponding words and phrases. 
Transcription: The recognized words are then transcribed into written text, creating a text document.
